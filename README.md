# Horiseon Web Page

## About The Project

This is the Homepage for Horiseon. Starting from the top,there is a header with a navigation bar on the right-hand sign.Below it is a cover image followed by a list of their services.Right beside their listed services is a sidebar listing the benefits of using their services. 

For the HTML code,all the tags contain semantic elements. Every element is confined onto one line. The img elements and the figure element also contain alt attributes that explain exactly what the image is to make the website more accessible. The CSS file contains all of the class selectors at the top. Following that are the different selectors for the header and its child elements that also include the navigation bar. Below are the styles for the services section which make the section float to the left and have images with text either to the right or left. The benefits class selectors after that style the sidebar the floats to the right of the services section containing small images with text below. Finally is the footer selectors which just change the font and padding.
